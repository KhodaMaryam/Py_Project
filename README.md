# Vehicle Traffic Simulation for Maneuver Dataset Generation

This PyGame project simulates a three-lane highway with 7 vehicles, including one controlled vehicle. The simulation generates datasets for different driving maneuvers by varying starting positions and vehicle interactions.

Key features:
1- We can control one vehicle's speed and direction (longitudinal and lateral)
2- Six surrounding vehicles have similar speeds
3- Three distinct lanes for maneuvers
4- Data generation for different maneuver types, lane keeping, and lane changes to the right and left

The simulation records:

  - Controlled vehicle lateral and longitudinal positions and velocity, and acceleration 
  - Relative distances between vehicles
  - Timestamps
